# ðŸ§  tiny-mlp

A tiny multi-layer perceptron. Implements back propagation over a small neural network. While small it is enough to build a small deep neurl net doing binary classification.

This project aims to broadly achieve two things:
1. To better understand backpropagation and optimzation algorithms
2. To learn how to write idomatic C++ 11, outdated... ik...
